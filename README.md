# Git Assignment - Pierre Kassis
1- What is an issue?
It is a feature on Github that allows us to track requested changes and features in a software project. 

2- What is a Pull request
Pull request is a feature that is used to suggest changes and to merge them on the main branch. We create change on the new branches created (assignment in this case) and we pull request for someone else to review it and approve it to main branch.

3- Describe the steps to open a pull request?
Click on Pull Request on the top --> New Pull Request --> Select base (Main) and Compare (Assignment) --> Add a title and discription --> click create pull request

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
Go to settings on your reporistory --> Collaborators (on the left) --> Add people (enter their username or email) --> Manage permissions and then add them and they need to accept


e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is the tool while github is the website. Git is the software that will let you make changes, check history, act locally on the computer. Github we transfer the local changes to it to collaborate with teams and create pull requests.

f. What does git diff do?
Git diff command will give you difference between branches

g. What is the main branch?
The main branch is the initial branch that we clone, and than we merge the changes to it. It's the one shared by all of the team, and changes need to be approved to change on this branch. 

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No never. We should make changes on the clones branch, from there we do all of the changes and then we do pull request for it to be approved and merged.
